# TODO: Function to calculate SVD of a low rank matrix.
# There are better and worse ways for it and generally low rank condition/assumpotion implies we can do this efficiently.
# I think TransformerLens probably has a good implementation of this.

# TODO: Function to calculate specctral entropy of signular values and calculate participaton ration.

# TODO: Function to keep track of changes in the top singular vectors and approximate the time point when they stablize

# TODO: Function to characcterize thr distribution of the signular values and identify the bluk and the outliers.
# I expect some long tail power law behavior and we will want to explicitly track the tail.
